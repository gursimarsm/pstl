The code is like a recipe that tells the computer how to make something. In this case, the code tells the computer how to make a picture of the stock prices and how to find the best times to buy and sell the stocks. The code has four main steps:

1\. The first step is to get the ingredients for the recipe. The ingredients are some tools and numbers that the computer needs to make the picture and find the best times. The tools are called pandas and matplotlib, and they help the computer to organize and draw the data. The numbers are called interval, retrace threshold and retrace min, and they help the computer to decide which parts of the data are important and which parts are not.

2\. The second step is to make some fake data for testing the recipe. The fake data is like a table with two columns: Date and Price. The Date column has 366 dates from January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020. The Price column has 366 random numbers from 100 to 300. These numbers represent how much one share of a company costs on each date. The fake data is just for testing the recipe. You can use any real or made-up data instead.

3\. The third step is to make some smaller steps that help with the main recipe. These smaller steps are called functions, and they tell the computer how to do some specific tasks. These functions are:

    - find_trendline_points: This function tells the computer how to find some special points in the data that show a pattern or a trend. A trend is when the prices go up or down for some time. A trendline point is a point where the price is either the highest or the lowest in a certain period of time. For example, if you look at the prices from January 1st to January 10th, you can see that the highest price is $145 on January 10th and the lowest price is $100 on January 1st. These are two trendline points for this period of time. The function tells the computer to divide the data into smaller parts based on the interval number, and find the highest and lowest prices in each part. Then it tells the computer to make a list of these points and return it.

    - find_valid_trendline_segments: This function tells the computer how to find some line segments that connect some trendline points and show a clear trend. A line segment is a straight line that joins two points. A valid trendline segment is a line segment that does not cross any other line segment and meets some conditions based on the retrace threshold and retrace min numbers. These conditions tell the computer how much the prices can go up or down before breaking the trend. For example, if you have a line segment that goes from $100 to $150, and the retrace threshold is 10%, then the prices can go down by 10% of $50 (which is $5) before breaking the trend. So, if the prices go down to $145 or lower, then the trend is broken and the line segment is not valid. The function tells the computer to loop through the list of trendline points and check for intersections and retracements with other line segments. If a line segment is valid, then it tells the computer to add it to another list and return it.

- intersect: This function tells the computer how to check if two line segments cross each other or not. The function uses some math formulas to find out if the points that make up the line segments are in a straight line or in a triangle. If they are in a straight line, then they may overlap or not. If they are in a triangle, then they may be clockwise or counterclockwise. The function tells the computer to use these formulas and compare the results to see if there is any crossing or not.

- orientation: This function tells the computer how to find out if three points are in a straight line or in a triangle, and if they are in a triangle, then whether they are clockwise or counterclockwise. The function uses some math formulas to find out the slope of the lines that join the points. The slope is how much the line goes up or down when it moves from left to right. The function tells the computer to use these formulas and compare the slopes to see if they are equal (straight line), less than (clockwise) or greater than (counterclockwise).

- on_segment: This function tells the computer how to check if a point lies on a line segment or not. The function checks if the point's coordinates (the numbers that tell where it is on a graph) are within the range of the coordinates of the end points of the line segment. For example, if you have a line segment that goes from (1,2) to (5,6), and you want to check if the point (3,4) lies on it or not, you can see that 3 is between 1 and 5, and 4 is between 2 and 6.

4\. The fourth step is to use the smaller steps to make the main recipe. This step calls the functions that were defined in the third step and uses their outputs to make the picture and find the best times. This step does the following things:

    - It calls the find_trendline_points function and gives it the dataframe and the interval as inputs. It gets back a list of trendline points as output.

    - It calls the find_valid_trendline_segments function and gives it the list of trendline points, the retrace threshold and the retrace min as inputs. It gets back a list of valid trendline segments as output.

    - It calls the find_and_execute_trades function and gives it the list of valid trendline segments and the dataframe as inputs. It gets back a list of trade signals as output. A trade signal is a set of information that tells when to buy or sell a stock, how much to risk and how much to expect in return. For example, a trade signal may say: buy at $210, sell at $231, risk $21, expect $21.

    - It prints the trade signals on the screen so that you can see them.

    - It uses matplotlib to draw the picture of the stock prices and the trendline segments on a graph. It uses plt.plot to draw lines and points with different colors and labels. It uses plt.legend, plt.xlabel, plt.ylabel and plt.title to add some details to the graph. It uses plt.show to display the graph on the screen.

    - It uses matplotlib to draw another picture of the stock prices and the trade signals on a graph. It uses plt.plot to draw lines and points with different colors and labels. It uses plt.legend, plt.xlabel, plt.ylabel and plt.title to add some details to the graph. It uses plt.show to display the graph on the screen.

This is the complete explanation of the code.
